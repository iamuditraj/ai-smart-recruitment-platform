Literature Review

1. Automated Resume Screening Using ML (2024)

K. Sharma et al., IEEE Access

This paper proposes a machine learning-based system that classifies and ranks resumes using NLP and skill-matching techniques.

Key Contributions:

Automated resume classification

NLP-based skill extraction

Resume ranking system

Limitations:

Limited explainability

No resume generation support

2. AI Resume Parsing & Skill Extraction (2025)

M. Lee et al., Springer

This research introduces an NLP-based approach to extract structured information such as skills, education, and experience from resumes.

Key Contributions:

Named Entity Recognition (NER) for resume parsing

Multi-format resume support

Structured candidate data extraction

Limitations:

No candidate scoring system

No recommendation mechanism

3. Online Skill Assessment Platform (2024)

A. Verma et al., Elsevier

This study presents a web-based platform for automated technical and aptitude testing during recruitment.

Key Contributions:

Early candidate filtering

Automated test scoring

Objective evaluation process

Limitations:

No integration with resume analysis

No interview evaluation module

4. Conversational AI Interview System (2025)

S. Rodriguez et al., ACM

This paper describes a chatbot-driven interview system using NLP for structured questioning and automated evaluation.

Key Contributions:

Simulated interview process

Reduced HR workload

Structured response analysis

Limitations:

Limited confidence scoring

No facial expression analysis

5. Vision-Based Facial Expression Analysis (2025)

R. Patel et al., MDPI

This research proposes a computer vision system to analyze facial expressions and engagement during interviews.

Key Contributions:

Real-time behavior analysis

Engagement detection

Limitations:

Lighting sensitivity

High computational cost

6. Explainable AI in Recruitment (2024)

L. Nguyen et al., IEEE Xplore

This study focuses on improving transparency and fairness in AI-based hiring decisions.

Key Contributions:

Transparent AI decision-making

Compliance support

Fair ranking framework

Limitations:

Conceptual framework

No real-time implementation

Research Gap Identified

Most existing systems focus on only one aspect:

Resume screening

OR skill assessment

OR interview analysis

There is limited integration of all modules into one end-to-end intelligent recruitment platform.
