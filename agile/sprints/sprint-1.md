Sprint 1 Documentation

Project: AI-Based Smart Recruitment Platform

1. Sprint Goal

The goal of Sprint 1 was to understand the recruitment domain, define the system architecture, select the technology stack, and plan the development process using Agile Scrum methodology.

This sprint focused on planning and system design rather than heavy implementation.

2. Problem Statement

Traditional recruitment faces several challenges:

Manual screening cannot handle large volumes of applications.

Keyword-based ATS systems fail to properly evaluate actual skills.

Skill assessment occurs late in the hiring process, increasing time and cost.

These issues lead to inefficiency, bias, and delayed hiring decisions.

3. Proposed Solution

We propose an AI-Based Smart Recruitment Platform that:

Uses NLP to parse resumes and extract skills and experience

Matches candidate profiles with job descriptions using AI scoring

Ranks candidates based on similarity and relevance

Includes a Mock Test Module for early technical skill assessment

Follows Agile Scrum for iterative development

4. Work Completed in Sprint 1

Conducted requirement analysis and domain research

Defined core system modules (Resume Parsing, Matching Engine, Mock Test, Dashboard)

Designed high-level system architecture:

Interaction Layer – User interface for candidates and recruiters

Processing Layer – NLP engine and AI scoring logic

Data Layer – Secure storage of resumes and results

Selected technology stack

Created GitHub repository structure

Prepared sprint roadmap

5. Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python / Node.js

AI/NLP: spaCy / NLTK for resume parsing and scoring

Database: Secure storage for resumes and test results

6. Next Sprint Plan

Implement resume parsing module

Develop candidate ranking logic

Build basic frontend interface

Integrate backend with database
